# Jarvis

ðŸ¤– Automating tasks for this project

- Copy all extensions in `flat-files` folder
- Generate `.md` files for all extensions.

## Why Jarvis Exists

Apart from automating whatever I needed, this project also acts as 
playground to try out new stuff. For example, currently I use it to 
study Kotlin `AST` which is also used to auto-generate `.md` files 
for all extension classes. Feel free to explore the code.
